# QR Code Component - Frontend Mentor Challenge

This project is a solution to the **QR Code Component Challenge** on Frontend Mentor. 
The goal was to build a **QR Code** component that is responsive and as close as possible to the original design. It was created using **HTML** and **CSS**, 
applying best practices in responsive design to ensure the component adapts well to various screen sizes.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Isaque-hubbitt/First-Challenge
  

---

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

**Note:** No additional dependencies are required for now. The project uses only **HTML** and **CSS**, with **Bootstrap** included for responsiveness.

## Next Steps

- Add more interactivity with **JavaScript**.
- Enhance the CSS with **SASS** for a more scalable and modular approach.
- Explore animations and transitions to improve the visual experience.

## Experience

This project helped me improve my **responsive design** skills using **Bootstrap** and gave me hands-on experience in making a website adaptable to different screen sizes. Iâ€™m looking forward to exploring more advanced concepts like **JavaScript** and **SASS** as I continue building my web development portfolio.

## Final Thoughts
While the challenge recommended focusing on **semantic HTML** elements, I decided to use **Bootstrap** to improve my skills with the framework. This approach allowed me to practice creating responsive layouts with a popular tool, which I believe will be beneficial for future projects.
